Overview

This project is part of an IT curriculum module focused on using AI (ChatGPT) to improve everyday coding practices. The goal is to integrate AI into two key areas of software development: debugging and automation.

Objectives

Debugging: Use ChatGPT to identify, analyze, and fix errors in code across multiple programming languages.

Automation: Automate repetitive tasks such as generating boilerplate code, documentation, and basic unit tests.

Learning Outcomes

Improved debugging skills and clearer problem analysis.

Increased productivity through AI-assisted automation.

Better-structured, cleaner, and more reliable code.

Notes

Always test and verify the output generated by ChatGPT. Use AI as a support tool, not a replacement for critical thinking.
